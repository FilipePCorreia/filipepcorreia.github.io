**Does paycheck frequency matter? Evidence from micro data** with [Brian Baugh](https://sites.google.com/site/briankbaugh/)
_Journal of Financial Economics. Vol. 143, Issue 3, 2022_ [link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X21005080)

Using a unique dataset from an account aggregator, we analyze cross-sectional differences and within-household time-series variation in paycheck frequency. We find that higher paycheck frequency results in less credit card borrowing, less consumption, but more instances of financial distress — even when the change in paycheck frequency is employer-initiated. We find that pay frequency strongly determines within-month time patterns of financial distress. Our theoretical model reconciles these empirical results — higher paycheck frequency increases consumers’ willingness to allocate to illiquid savings vehicles, leading to a reduction in both consumption and within-paycycle borrowing.

**Is Corporate Credit Risk Propagated to Employees?** with [Gustavo Cortes](https://sites.google.com/site/cortesgustavos/) and Thiago Christiano Silva 
[Paper](https://www.bcb.gov.br/pec/wps/ingl/wps551.pdf)

As rising household debt became a widespread global phenomenon, understanding the sources of consumer credit risk has been crucial for financial and macroeconomic stability. We analyze employer-employee relationships from the perspective of banks to study the financial linkages between a firms’ credit conditions and their employees’ credit outcomes. We combine administrative credit registry data with the universe of labor contracts in Brazil to investigate if credit risk spills over from firms to their employees. We find that employees of credit-rating-downgraded companies have access to 20% less and 10% more expensive credit, compared to similar employees of non-downgraded firms. Downgraded-firm workers are also 5 p.p. more likely to default on loans compared to employees from unaffected publicly-listed firms. These negative financial effects have real consequences and are larger for non-executive personnel, who cut 9% on consumption following the downgrade. Finally, we document that banks price an employee’s risk of unemployment after an employer’s downgrade since these effects are one order of magnitude stronger for “payroll loans,” i.e., credit taken against a worker’s salary.



**The Online Payday Loan Premium** with Peter Han and [Jialan Wang](https://sites.google.com/site/jialanw/)
[Preliminary Paper](https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/2022/preliminary/paper/e4EnG7RR)

Using data from a subprime credit bureau with nationwide coverage in the United States, we investigate the potential for online technology to lower fixed costs and increase lending efficiency in the expensive payday loan market. We find that prices for online loans are about 100% APR higher than storefront loans. This premium is not explained by loan or customer characteristics, differences in pricing models, or traditional measures of credit risk. At least part of the online payday loan premium seems to be due to default rates that are double that for storefront loans. Customers with both types of loans are much more likely to default on online loans.

Informal loans are largely understudied, and informal lending communities are an open space for FinTech intervention. We collect a dataset on an online informal lending community to examine it, using the 2020 pandemic as a laboratory. We find that these informal loans are short duration, expensive and that borrowers and lenders exhibit a sense of community, in a market where reputation and narratives are key. Our results suggest that in hard times, borrowers reduce loan demand. Loans directly associated with the pandemic are more likely to be transacted by newcomers to this market, and mentioning the pandemic in a loan request lowers the chance that it originates a loan. The absence of an increase of violations of community rules and the reduction in promised repayment time highlights the importance of reputation on informal credit communities in hard times.
